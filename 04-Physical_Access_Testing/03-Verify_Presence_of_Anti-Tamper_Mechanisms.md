|CHSTG-PHY-03|

## Summary

This control aims to verify, after device disassembly, whether physical anti-tamper mechanisms are present. The objective is to identify hardware-based protections designed to detect or react to unauthorized opening of the system.

## Test Objectives
- Identify presence of physical anti-tamper mechanisms
- Detect hardware-based intrusion detection components
- Assess whether the device integrates physical protection features

## How to Test
1. Disassemble the device using standard procedures.

2. Visually inspect internal components and chassis areas.

3. Identify possible anti-tamper mechanisms such as:
   - Chassis intrusion switches
   - Kill switches
   - Tamper detection pads
   - Conductive traces linked to cover detection
   - Mechanical sensors triggered by cover removal

4. Document the presence, location, and type of identified mechanisms.

## Remediation
Not applicable.
