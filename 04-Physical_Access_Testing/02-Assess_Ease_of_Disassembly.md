|CHSTG-PHY-02|

## Summary

This control aims to assess whether the device can be easily disassembled based on external observation. The objective is to evaluate the simplicity of the disassembly process, including the absence of hidden screws, the absence of specialized tools, and whether disassembly could occur without causing visible damage.

## Test Objectives
- Determine whether disassembly appears straightforward
- Identify presence of hidden screws
- Identify requirement for specialized tools
- Assess whether disassembly could occur without visible damage

## How to Test
1. Perform a detailed visual inspection of the device exterior.

2. Identify:
   - Presence of visible screws
   - Possible hidden screws (under rubber feet, labels, or covers)
   - Type of screw heads (standard or proprietary)

3. Assess whether disassembly would likely require:
   - Standard tools only
   - Specialized tools
   - Destructive actions (breaking clips or seals)

4. Evaluate whether the device design appears to allow disassembly without causing visible damage.

5. Document the overall ease of disassembly.

## Remediation
No true remediation exists. Applying tamper-evident seals over screws may provide visual indication of disassembly but does not prevent physical access.
