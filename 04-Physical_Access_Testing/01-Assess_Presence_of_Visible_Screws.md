## Summary

This control aims to determine whether device disassembly screws are externally visible and whether they use standard screw types (e.g., Phillips M2.5). The objective is to assess the ease of physical access based solely on visual inspection.

## Test Objectives
- Identify presence of externally visible screws
- Determine whether screws are standard or specialized
- Assess ease of disassembly based on screw type

## How to Test
1. Perform a visual inspection of the device exterior.

2. Identify:
   - Number of visible screws
   - Location of screws
   - Screw head type (e.g., Phillips, Torx, proprietary)

3. Determine whether the screws are:
   - Standard and commonly available (e.g., Phillips M2.5)
   - Specialized or uncommon

4. Document the type and accessibility of the screws.

## Remediation
No true remediation exists. Applying tamper-evident seals over screws may provide visual indication of disassembly but does not prevent physical access.
