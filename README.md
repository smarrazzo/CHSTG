## AI Usage Disclosure

This methodology was structured and formatted with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools.

The AI was used **exclusively for formatting, structure harmonization, and language refinement**, in order to maintain a consistent methodology framework across all sections.

Due to dyslexia, writing and maintaining large structured documentation is particularly challenging. AI assistance was therefore used as a support tool for editorial consistency and readability.

**Important:**  
All technical content, testing steps, attack paths, methodology design, and security concepts were conceived, designed, and validated manually without AI-generated methodology decisions.

AI did not design, invent, or define any testing procedure contained in this guide.
