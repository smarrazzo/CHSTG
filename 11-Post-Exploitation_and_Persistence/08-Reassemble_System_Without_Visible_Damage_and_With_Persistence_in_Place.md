## Summary

The final phase of a hardware-based compromise is the restoration of the system to its original physical state to avoid detection. This control evaluates whether an attacker can reassemble the device after performing internal tampering (such as installing hardware implants, sniffing the TPM bus, or bypassing internal interlocks) without leaving behind visible forensic traces like scratches, broken plastic clips, or damaged warranty seals. Successful reassembly with active persistence allows for long-term, undetected access.

## Test Objectives
- Evaluate the difficulty of restoring the device's exterior to a "factory-new" appearance.
- Verify that all anti-tamper mechanisms (physical and digital) can be reset or replaced without detection.
- Confirm that the system remains fully functional and that all implanted persistence mechanisms remain active after reassembly.

## How to Test
This test is conducted after all other hardware and software manipulations have been completed. It focuses on the physical integrity and stealth of the final product.

### Prerequisites
- All previous hardware/software attacks (e.g., DMA, TPM sniffing, OS-level persistence) have been performed.
- Access to specialized reassembly tools (e.g., heat guns, replacement adhesive, specialized screwdrivers).

### Execution Steps
1.  **Component Reinstallation**: Carefully reinstall all internal shields, cables, and screws.
2.  **Sealing and Cleanup**:
    - **Cosmetic Check**: Use plastic prying tools (spudgers) and cleaning agents to remove any tool marks or fingerprints from the interior and exterior.
    * **Seal Restoration**: Attempt to re-apply original warranty stickers or "Void" seals using heat and precision tweezers. If the original is damaged, check the feasibility of applying a matching counterfeit seal.
3.  **Physical Inspection**: Inspect the device under high-intensity light. Look for gaps in the chassis, mismatched screw heads, or uneven panels.
4.  **Functional Verification**: Power on the system and verify it boots normally into the target OS.
5.  **Persistence Check**: Trigger the implanted backdoor (e.g., the Sticky Keys/FTP backdoor from **CHSTG-POST-03**) to ensure it survived the physical closure of the device.
    - **Success Criteria (FAILED)**: The test is marked as **FAILED** if the system is reassembled without visible damage and the persistence remains fully functional.

## Remediation
If the initial physical security or encryption has failed, detection of reassembly is the last line of defense:
- **Tamper-Evident Seals**: Use high-quality, ultra-destructible security labels that cannot be removed even with heat or chemicals without leaving a permanent "VOID" pattern.
- **Intrusion Detection (Chassis Switch)**: Enable "Chassis Intrusion Detection" in the BIOS/UEFI. Configure the system to log a permanent alert in the TPM or stop the boot process if the case has been opened.
- **Physical Design**: Use specialized, non-standard security screws (e.g., Pentalobe or Torx Plus Security) that are difficult to operate without leaving marks.
- **Case Integrity**: Use unibody designs or adhesive-heavy assemblies that make opening the device without destroying components or panels extremely difficult.
