# Boot from External Media for Offline OS Manipulation

|CHSTG-POST-01|

## Summary

Once full disk encryption has been bypassed or neutralized in previous stages of the audit, the attacker can attempt to boot the hardware into a secondary, controlled operating system (such as a Live USB or WinPE environment). This "offline" state allows for the direct manipulation of the target's original system files, registry hives, and binaries without the original OS's security controls (AV, EDR, or File System Permissions) being active. This control evaluates the feasibility of performing such tampering to achieve permanent access or system modification.

## Test Objectives
- Determine if the system configuration allows booting from external unauthorized media.
- Verify the ability to mount and modify the target operating system's filesystem while it is offline.
- Assess the risk of unauthorized system configuration changes or the planting of persistent backdoors.

## How to Test
This test is a post-exploitation step conducted after disk access has been achieved. It requires no internal disassembly but does require access to external ports (USB/Thunderbolt).

### Prerequisites
- The target disk must be unencrypted or the decryption keys must have been successfully applied (refer to the **CHSTG-DISK** node).
- A bootable external medium (e.g., a Live Linux USB or a Windows Preinstallation Environment).

### Execution Steps
1.  **Boot Attempt**: Insert the external medium and attempt to trigger the boot menu (usually via F12, F10, or ESC).
2.  **Environment Access**: Boot into the external OS.
3.  **Mount Target Volume**: Identify and mount the primary system partition of the target hardware.

## Remediation
If the preceding attacks (such as key extraction) have already succeeded, remediation at this specific stage is extremely limited as the hardware's trust has been broken.
