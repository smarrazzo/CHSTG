## Summary

This control aims to determine whether the device includes a Thunderbolt 3 port using external visual inspection and publicly available commercial and technical documentation. The objective is to confirm the presence of this interface without physically interacting with the system.

## Test Objectives
- Identify presence of a Thunderbolt 3 port
- Confirm port type using official documentation
- Correlate visual observations with technical specifications

## How to Test
1. Perform an external visual inspection of the device:
   - Look for Thunderbolt symbols near ports
   - Identify USB-C ports that may support Thunderbolt 3

Example: The USB-C port is highlighted in green, while the presence of Thunderbolt 3 functionality is shown in blue.
