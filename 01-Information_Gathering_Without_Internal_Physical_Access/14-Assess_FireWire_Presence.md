# Assess FireWire Presence

|ID          |
|------------|
|CHSTG-INFO-14|

## Summary

This control aims to determine whether the device includes a FireWire port using external visual inspection and publicly available commercial and technical documentation. The objective is to confirm the presence of this interface without physically interacting with the system.

## Test Objectives
- Identify presence of a FireWire port
- Confirm port type using official documentation
- Correlate visual observations with technical specifications

## How to Test
1. Perform an external visual inspection of the device:
   - Look for FireWire symbols near ports
   - Identify typical FireWire connectors (4-pin, 6-pin, or 9-pin)

Example: FireWire 800 port (IEEE 1394b) on a MacBook Pro 2011.

2. Use the exact device model identified during test CHSTG-INFO-01.

3. Consult manufacturer commercial and technical documentation:
   - Product specification sheets
   - User manuals
   - Port diagrams

4. Confirm whether the connector corresponds to a FireWire interface.

5. Document the presence or absence of FireWire for later analysis.

## Remediation
Not applicable.
