# Assess Thunderbolt 4 Presence

|ID          |
|------------|
|CHSTG-INFO-12|

## Summary

This control aims to determine whether the device includes a Thunderbolt 4 port using external visual inspection and publicly available commercial and technical documentation. The objective is to confirm the presence of this interface without physically interacting with the system.

## Test Objectives
- Identify presence of a Thunderbolt 4 port
- Confirm port type using official documentation
- Correlate visual observations with technical specifications

## How to Test
1. Perform an external visual inspection of the device:
   - Look for Thunderbolt symbols near ports
   - Identify USB-C ports that may support Thunderbolt 4

Note: Visually, the Thunderbolt 4 port is nearly identical to the Thunderbolt 3 port. They share the same form factor (USB-C) and the same lightning bolt logo. Sometimes, a “4” is added next to the lightning bolt symbol to indicate Thunderbolt 4, but this marking may also designate a USB4 port without Thunderbolt support. Therefore, it is necessary to consult the manufacturer's official documentation or technical specifications to distinguish between Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB4.

2. Use the exact device model identified during test CHSTG-INFO-01.

3. Consult manufacturer commercial and technical documentation:
   - Product specification sheets
   - User manuals
   - Port diagrams

4. Confirm whether the USB-C port corresponds to:
   - Standard USB-C
   - Thunderbolt 4 interface

5. Document the presence or absence of Thunderbolt 4 for later analysis.

## Remediation
Not applicable.
