|CHSTG-INT-01|

## Summary

This control aims to identify the exact motherboard model and hardware revision after device disassembly. The objective is to collect motherboard-specific identifiers and correlate them with previously gathered information from CHSTG-INFO-01.

## Test Objectives
- Identify motherboard model and revision markings
- Compare internal findings with external identification results
- Refine OSINT information gathering using internal identifiers

## How to Test
1. Disassemble the device according to standard procedures.

2. Locate motherboard identification markings, such as:
   - Printed board model reference
   - PCB revision number
   - Serial number
   - Manufacturer code

3. Record all identifiers exactly as written on the motherboard.

4. Compare collected information with results obtained during CHSTG-INFO-01.

5. If new or more precise identifiers are found, repeat the OSINT Information Gathering phase using:
   - Motherboard reference
   - PCB revision number
   - Internal part numbers

6. Document any discrepancies or newly identified hardware revisions.

## Remediation
Not applicable.
