## Summary

This control aims to determine whether the system storage (SSD) is soldered directly onto the motherboard or installed as a removable module. The objective is to assess the physical replaceability of the storage device.

## Test Objectives
- Identify whether the SSD is soldered to the motherboard
- Determine presence of removable storage modules
- Assess physical storage replaceability

## How to Test
1. Open the device according to standard disassembly procedures.

2. Visually inspect the storage area on the motherboard.

3. Determine whether:
   - Storage chips are soldered directly onto the motherboard
   - A removable storage module (e.g., M.2, SATA SSD) is present

4. Document the storage configuration (fully soldered or removable).
