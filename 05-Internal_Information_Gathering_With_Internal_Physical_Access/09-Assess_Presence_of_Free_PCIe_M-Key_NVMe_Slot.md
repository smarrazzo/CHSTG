## Summary

This control aims to determine whether a free PCIe M-Key (NVMe) slot is present on the motherboard. The objective is to identify the availability of an unused high-speed internal storage expansion interface.

## Test Objectives
- Identify presence of a PCIe M-Key (NVMe) slot
- Determine whether the slot is populated or free
- Assess availability of internal NVMe expansion capability

## How to Test
1. Open the device according to standard disassembly procedures.

2. Visually inspect the motherboard for M.2 slots.

3. Identify whether a PCIe M-Key (NVMe) slot is present.

4. Determine whether:
   - The slot is populated by an NVMe storage device
   - The slot is present but unused (free)

5. Document the presence and status (occupied or free) of the PCIe M-Key (NVMe) slot.
