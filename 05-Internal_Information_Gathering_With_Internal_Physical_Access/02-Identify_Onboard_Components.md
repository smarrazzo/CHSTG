## Summary

This control aims to assess the accessibility of onboard components after device disassembly. The objective is to determine whether key components are easily accessible or protected by shielding or additional physical barriers.

## Test Objectives
- Identify key onboard components
- Assess physical accessibility of components
- Determine presence of shielding or protective barriers

## How to Test
1. Disassemble the device according to standard procedures.

2. Visually inspect the motherboard and internal layout.

3. Identify key components such as:
   - BIOS/UEFI chip
   - Embedded controller
   - TPM chip
   - Storage controller
   - Other security-relevant components

Examples :

4. Evaluate whether components are:
   - Directly accessible
   - Covered by shielding
   - Protected by epoxy, metal shields, or additional barriers

5. Document the level of accessibility for each identified component.
